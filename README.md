#Microsoft Bot Framework Hands-On Lab: Mars Challenge

Welcome to the Mars Challenge. The Mars Challenge is a series of hands-on labs with a twist to it... You will be briefed on your missions later on in the lab.

###Prerequisites (try to do before the lab starts)

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). After you've installed this, open your command line and run `npm install npm -g`. This updates Node's Package Manager (npm) to the latest version.
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or any other code editor of your choice)
- Install [Bot Framework emulator](https://emulator.botframework.com)
- Activate your Azure Pass. Instructions [here](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/howto). If you already activated Microsoft Imagine (or any other subscription), please use it for the lab. The Azure Pass cannot be used alongside any other subscription.
